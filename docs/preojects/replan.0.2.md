1. Final terminology (this is the one to commit to)
Company (Firma)

The legal and accounting entity.

Department (Dział)

A line of business / organizational unit inside the company.

Examples:

Marketing

Sales

Construction

Property Administration

SaaS / Product

Operations

A department:

exists long-term

has its own goals

has its own budget and profitability

has its own team and rules

Job / Project / Work Order

A time-bound execution unit inside a department.

Examples:

Marketing → Campaign “Summer 2025”

Construction → Job “Roof repair – Building A”

Administration → Job “Elevator inspection – March”

Sales → Event “Trade fair Berlin”

This is the thing that starts and ends.

2. Hierarchy (simple and correct)
Company
 └── Department
      └── Job / Project


Nothing more is needed.

3. What each level owns (hard rules)
Company owns

Legal accounting

Tax reporting

Global ledger

Company-wide decisions

Company-wide users

Department owns

Department P&L

Default invoice numbering

Default cost categories

Department-level decisions

Department team membership

Department analytics

Job / Project owns

Job budget (e.g. kosztorys)

Job timeline / milestones

Job documents

Job profitability

Job-specific decisions (accept, change, freeze, close)

4. How this works across markets (examples)
A) Marketing department

Jobs:

Campaign Q1

Campaign Q2

Trade fair

Influencer collaboration

Each job:

has a budget

has costs (ads, travel, creatives)

has outcomes (leads, conversions)

You can now answer:

“Which campaign actually worked?”

B) Construction department

Jobs:

Building X

Renovation Y

Contract Z

Each job:

has kosztorys

has materials and labor

has acceptance protocols

has margins

You can answer:

“Which contract lost money?”

C) Property administration department

Jobs:

Repair incident

Annual inspection

Contractor assignment

Each job:

has approvals

has invoices

has documentation

You can answer:

“Which building or service is draining funds?”

5. What happens when a company has NO departments

For small businesses:

Company acts as the only “implicit department”

Header selector hidden

Jobs optional or unused

When they grow:

They add departments

System naturally expands

This is perfect progressive disclosure.

6. UI implications (you’re already aligned)
Header selector

Becomes:

Department selector

Appears only when 2+ departments exist

“All departments” = company view

Inside a department

Show:

Department dashboard

Jobs / Projects tab

Team tab

Documents tab

Decisions tab

7. Why this naming matters (very important)

Using Department instead of Project:

avoids confusion in construction

avoids confusion in marketing

avoids confusion internationally

matches ERP/enterprise language

makes onboarding much easier

Users expect:

departments to have many projects

projects to belong to departments

You are now aligned with that mental model.

8. The one sentence definition to remember

A Department defines responsibility and budget.
A Job defines execution and outcome.

If you stick to that, your system will stay coherent for years.
